# Two-Player-PingPong-game

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:

This project is a two-player Pong game implemented in Java using the Swing GUI framework. It simulates a classic arcade-style table tennis match, where each player controls a vertical paddle on opposite sides of the screen to hit a moving ball. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points against the opponent.
What I learned from developing this project were being able to developed a real-time interactive game using standard Java. Gained experience with event-driven programming and game loops. Applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage game entities. Practiced GUI development using Swing, and managed rendering and timing.
